This project allows you to easily share your professional resume with a single command, making it simple for recruiters and potential employers to view your qualifications without any setup hassle.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Portable:** Run your resume anywhere Docker is installed.
* **Consistent Display:** Avoids formatting issues by encapsulating all dependencies.
* **Easy Sharing:** Share your resume by simply providing instructions to run the Docker image.
* **Customizable:** Easily update your resume content by modifying source files.
* **Version Controlled:** Keep your resume history organized with Git.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **Docker:** For containerization and environment isolation.
* **[Specify technologies used for your resume content, e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Markdown, LaTeX, etc.]**
    * Example: HTML5, CSS3 for structure and styling.
    * Example: Markdown for easy content creation.
    * Example: Nginx (or other web server) for serving the resume.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of your resume container up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Balu-monish/DockerContainerResume.git](https://github.com/Balu-monish/DockerContainerResume.git)
    cd DockerContainerResume
    ```

2.  **Build the Docker image:**
    This command will build the Docker image for your resume.
    ```bash
    docker build -t my-resume .
    ```
    (Replace `my-resume` with a more descriptive name if you prefer, e.g., `yourusername-resume`)

3.  **Run the Docker container:**
    This command will start a Docker container and make your resume accessible via your web browser.
    ```bash
    docker run -p 80:80 my-resume
    ```
    The `-p 80:80` flag maps port 80 of your host to port 80 of the container. If port 80 is already in use, you can choose another port, e.g., `-p 8080:80`.

## üåê Usage

Once the container is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

* `http://localhost` (if you used `-p 80:80`)
* `http://localhost:8080` (if you used `-p 8080:80` or your chosen port)

You should see your resume displayed in the browser.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Customization

To update your resume content:

1.  Modify the relevant source files in the repository (e.g., `index.html`, `resume.json`, `styles.css` ‚Äì depending on how your resume is structured).
2.  After making changes, rebuild the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t my-resume .
    ```
3.  Stop any running containers (if applicable) and restart the container:
    ```bash
    docker stop <container_id_or_name> # Find ID with `docker ps`
    docker run -p 80:80 my-resume
    ```
